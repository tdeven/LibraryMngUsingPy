# Arithmetic Operator
# Operator     Name
# +-> Addition
# - -> Subtraction
# * -> Multiplication
# / -> Division
# % Modulus
# ** Exponentiation --> To find power  the we use exponentiation. For e.g. , n1**n2 means that n2 is power of n1
# // Floor Division --> Return nearest whole number e.g. 4/3= 1.33 So, 4//3 the answer is 1

# print("sum:", 4+3)
# print("sub:",4-3)
# print("mub:",4*3)
# print("div:",4/3)
# print("floor division:", 4//3)
# print("remainder:", 4%3)
# print("Exponentiation:", 4 ** 3)

# #Assignment Operator
# n1 = 5
# n2 = n1
# print(n1,n2)
# n2 += n1
# print(n1, n2)

#Comparison Operator


#Identity Operator

#is--> Returns True if both variables are the same object

#is not--> Returns True if both variables are not the same object

# x=5
# y=5
# print("If x and y:", x is y)
# print("If x is not y:", x is not y)

# Membership Operators
# in
# not in

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print("if banana is present in fruits:", "banana" in fruits)
# print("if mango is not present in fruits:", "mango" not in fruits)

# Bitwise Operator


#Calculating Volume of a sphere
